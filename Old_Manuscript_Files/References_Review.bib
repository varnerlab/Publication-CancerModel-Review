@article{Jawhar2009,
	Abstract = {Tissue microarray is a recent innovation in the field of pathology. A microarray contains many small representative tissue samples from hundreds of different cases assembled on a single histologic slide, and therefore allows high throughput analysis of multiple specimens at the same time. Tissue microarrays are paraffin blocks produced by extracting cylindrical tissue cores from different paraffin donor blocks and re-embedding these into a single recipient (microarray) block at defined array coordinates. Using this technique, up to 1000 or more tissue samples can be arrayed into a single paraffin block. It can permit simultaneous analysis of molecular targets at the DNA, mRNA, and protein levels under identical, standardized conditions on a single glass slide, and also provide maximal preservation and use of limited and irreplaceable archival tissue samples. This versatile technique, in which data analysis is automated, facilitates retrospective and prospective human tissue studies. It is a practical and effective tool for high-throughput molecular analysis of tissues that is helping to identify new diagnostic and prognostic markers and targets in human cancers, and has a range of potential applications in basic research, prognostic oncology and drug discovery. This article summarizes the technical aspects of tissue microarray construction and sectioning, advantages, application, and limitations.},

	Abstract = {We present an imaging system that collects hyperspectral images of cells travelling through a microfluidic channel. Using a single monochrome camera and a linear variable bandpass filter (LVF), the system captures a bright field image and a set of hyperspectral fluorescence images for each cell. While the bandwidth of the LVF is 20 nm, we have demonstrated that we can determine the peak wavelength of a fluorescent object's emission spectrum with an accuracy of below 3 nm. In addition, we have used this system to capture fluorescence spectra of individual spatially resolved cellular organelles and to spectrally resolve multiple fluorophores in individual cells.},

@article{Ponten2011,
	Abstract = {The analysis of tissue-specific expression at both the gene and protein levels is vital for understanding human biology and disease. Antibody-based proteomics provides a strategy for the systematic generation of antibodies against all human proteins to combine with protein profiling in tissues and cells using tissue microarrays, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. The Human Protein Atlas project was launched in 2003 with the aim of creating a map of protein expression patterns in normal cells, tissues and cancer. At present, 11,200 unique proteins corresponding to over 50% of all human protein-encoding genes have been analysed. All protein expression data, including underlying high-resolution images, are published on the free and publically available Human Protein Atlas portal (http://www.proteinatlas.org). This database provides an important source of information for numerous biomedical research projects, including biomarker discovery efforts. Moreover, the global analysis of how our genome is expressed at the protein level has provided basic knowledge on the ubiquitous expression of a large proportion of our proteins and revealed the paucity of cell- and tissue-type-specific proteins.},

@article{Vanneman2012,
	Abstract = {During the past two decades, the paradigm for cancer treatment has evolved from relatively nonspecific cytotoxic agents to selective, mechanism-based therapeutics. Cancer chemotherapies were initially identified through screens for compounds that killed rapidly dividing cells. These drugs remain the backbone of current treatment, but they are limited by a narrow therapeutic index, significant toxicities and frequently acquired resistance. More recently, an improved understanding of cancer pathogenesis has given rise to new treatment options, including targeted agents and cancer immunotherapy. Targeted approaches aim to inhibit molecular pathways that are crucial for tumour growth and maintenance; whereas, immunotherapy endeavours to stimulate a host immune response that effectuates long-lived tumour destruction. Targeted therapies and cytotoxic agents also modulate immune responses, which raises the possibility that these treatment strategies might be effectively combined with immunotherapy to improve clinical outcomes.},

Gene expression profiling has contributed significantly to our understanding of this heterogeneity at a molecular level, refining taxonomy based on simple measures such as histological type, tumour grade, lymph node status and the presence of predictive markers like oestrogen receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) to a more sophisticated classification comprising luminal A, luminal B, basal-like, HER2-positive and normal subgroups. In the laboratory, breast cancer is often modelled using established cell lines. In the present review we discuss some of the issues surrounding the use of breast cancer cell lines as experimental models, in light of these revised clinical classifications, and put forward suggestions for improving their use in translational breast cancer research.},

A growing number of examples illustrate the value of this approach in providing quantitative insights in the initiation, progression, and treatment of cancer. In this review, we introduce the most recent and important multiscale cancer modeling works that have successfully established a mechanistic link between different biological scales. Biophysical, biochemical, and biomechanical factors are considered in these models. We also discuss innovative, cutting-edge modeling methods that are moving predictive multiscale cancer modeling toward clinical application. Furthermore, because the development of multiscale cancer models requires a new level of collaboration among scientists from a variety of fields such as biology, medicine, physics, mathematics, engineering, and computer science, an innovative Web-based infrastructure is needed to support this growing community.},

@article{Andasari2012,
	Abstract = {In this paper we present a multiscale, individual-based simulation environment that integrates CompuCell3D for lattice-based modelling on the cellular level and Bionetsolver for intracellular modelling. CompuCell3D or CC3D provides an implementation of the lattice-based Cellular Potts Model or CPM (also known as the Glazier-Graner-Hogeweg or GGH model) and a Monte Carlo method based on the metropolis algorithm for system evolution. The integration of CC3D for cellular systems with Bionetsolver for subcellular systems enables us to develop a multiscale mathematical model and to study the evolution of cell behaviour due to the dynamics inside of the cells, capturing aspects of cell behaviour and interaction that is not possible using continuum approaches. We then apply this multiscale modelling technique to a model of cancer growth and invasion, based on a previously published model of Ramis-Conde et al. (2008) where individual cell behaviour is driven by a molecular network describing the dynamics of E-cadherin and β-catenin. In this model, which we refer to as the centre-based model, an alternative individual-based modelling technique was used, namely, a lattice-free approach. In many respects, the GGH or CPM methodology and the approach of the centre-based model have the same overall goal, that is to mimic behaviours and interactions of biological cells. Although the mathematical foundations and computational implementations of the two approaches are very different, the results of the presented simulations are compatible with each other, suggesting that by using individual-based approaches we can formulate a natural way of describing complex multi-cell, multiscale models. The ability to easily reproduce results of one modelling approach using an alternative approach is also essential from a model cross-validation standpoint and also helps to identify any modelling artefacts specific to a given computational approach.},

@article{Kaul2013,
	Abstract = {Capturing the dynamism that pervades biological systems requires a computational approach that can accommodate both the continuous features of the system environment as well as the flexible and heterogeneous nature of component interactions. This presents a serious challenge for the more traditional mathematical approaches that assume component homogeneity to relate system observables using mathematical equations. While the homogeneity condition does not lead to loss of accuracy while simulating various continua, it fails to offer detailed solutions when applied to systems with dynamically interacting heterogeneous components. As the functionality and architecture of most biological systems is a product of multi-faceted individual interactions at the sub-system level, continuum models rarely offer much beyond qualitative similarity. Agent-based modelling is a class of algorithmic computational approaches that rely on interactions between Turing-complete finite-state machines-or agents-to simulate, from the bottom-up, macroscopic properties of a system. In recognizing the heterogeneity condition, they offer suitable ontologies to the system components being modelled, thereby succeeding where their continuum counterparts tend to struggle. Furthermore, being inherently hierarchical, they are quite amenable to coupling with other computational paradigms. The integration of any agent-based framework with continuum models is arguably the most elegant and precise way of representing biological systems. Although in its nascence, agent-based modelling has been utilized to model biological complexity across a broad range of biological scales (from cells to societies). In this article, we explore the reasons that make agent-based modelling the most precise approach to model biological systems that tend to be non-linear and complex.},

	Abstract = {Cancer can be viewed as the loss of cooperative cell behaviors that normally facilitate multicellularity, including the formation of tissues and organs. Hanahan and Weinberg describe the phenotypic differences between healthy and cancerous cells in an article titled "The Hallmarks of Cancer" (Cell, 100, 57-70, 2000). Here the authors propose six phenotypic changes at the cellular level as the essential hallmarks of cancer. They investigate the dynamics and interactions of these hallmarks in a model known as CancerSim. They describe how CancerSim implements the hallmarks in an agent-based simulation which can help test the hypotheses put forth by Hanahan and Weinberg. Experiments with CancerSim are described that study the interactions of cell phenotype alterations, and in particular, the likely sequences of precancerous mutations, known as pathways. The experiments show that sequencing is an important factor in tumorigenesis, as some mutations have preconditions--they are selectively advantageous only in combination with other mutations. CancerSim enables a modeler to study the dynamics of a developing tumor and simulate how progression can be altered by tuning model parameters.},

	Abstract = {The immune system is comprised of numerous components that interact with one another to give rise to phenotypic behaviors that are sometimes unexpected. Agent-based modeling (ABM) and cellular automata (CA) belong to a class of discrete mathematical approaches in which autonomous entities detect local information and act over time according to logical rules. The power of this approach lies in the emergence of behavior that arises from interactions between agents, which would otherwise be impossible to know a priori. Recent work exploring the immune system with ABM and CA has revealed novel insights into immunological processes. Here, we summarize these applications to immunology and, particularly, how ABM can help formulate hypotheses that might drive further experimental investigations of disease mechanisms.},

@article{Massey2012,
	Abstract = {Currently available glioma treatments remain unsuccessful at prolonging disease-free remission. Recent evidence suggests that tumour recruitment of glial progenitor cells by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) may play a role in the development and progression of these tumours. Building upon our recent experimental results and previous proliferation-invasion (PI) reaction-diffusion model, in this study, we created a proliferation-invasion-recruitment (PIR) model that includes a mechanism for progenitor cell recruitment, wherein paracrine PDGF signalling stimulates migration and proliferation of progenitors derived from the local brain environment. Parametrizing this mathematical model with data obtained from the PDGF-driven rat glioma model, we explored the consequences of recruitment, using the PIR model to compare the effects of high versus low PDGF secretion rates on tumour growth and invasion dynamics. The mathematical model predicts correlation between high levels of recruitment and both increased radial velocity of expansion on magnetic resonance imaging and less diffusely invasive edges. Thus, the PIR model predicts that PDGF levels correlate with tumour aggressiveness, and results are consistent with both human and experimental data, demonstrating that the effects of progenitor cell recruitment provide a novel mechanism to explain the variability in the rates of proliferation and dispersion observed in human gliomas.},

	Abstract = {We investigate a three-dimensional multiscale model of vascular tumour growth, which couples blood flow, angiogenesis, vascular remodelling, nutrient/growth factor transport, movement of, and interactions between, normal and tumour cells, and nutrient-dependent cell cycle dynamics within each cell. In particular, we determine how the domain size, aspect ratio and initial vascular network influence the tumour's growth dynamics and its long-time composition. We establish whether it is possible to extrapolate simulation results obtained for small domains to larger ones, by constructing a large simulation domain from a number of identical subdomains, each subsystem initially comprising two parallel parent vessels, with associated cells and diffusible substances. We find that the subsystem is not representative of the full domain and conclude that, for this initial vessel geometry, interactions between adjacent subsystems contribute to the overall growth dynamics. We then show that extrapolation of results from a small subdomain to a larger domain can only be made if the subdomain is sufficiently large and is initialised with a sufficiently complex vascular network. Motivated by these results, we perform simulations to investigate the tumour's response to therapy and show that the probability of tumour elimination in a larger domain can be extrapolated from simulation results on a smaller domain. Finally, we demonstrate how our model may be combined with experimental data, to predict the spatio-temporal evolution of a vascular tumour.},

@article{Chakrabarti2012,
	Abstract = {Breast cancer initiation, invasion and metastasis span multiple length and time scales. Molecular events at short length scales lead to an initial tumorigenic population, which left unchecked by immune action, acts at increasingly longer length scales until eventually the cancer cells escape from the primary tumor site. This series of events is highly complex, involving multiple cell types interacting with (and shaping) the microenvironment. Multiscale mathematical models have emerged as a powerful tool to quantitatively integrate the convective-diffusion-reaction processes occurring on the systemic scale, with the molecular signaling processes occurring on the cellular and subcellular scales. In this study, we reviewed the current state of the art in cancer modeling across multiple length scales, with an emphasis on the integration of intracellular signal transduction models with pro-tumorigenic chemical and mechanical microenvironmental cues. First, we reviewed the underlying biomolecular origin of breast cancer, with a special emphasis on angiogenesis. Then, we summarized the development of tissue engineering platforms which could provide high-fidelity ex vivo experimental models to identify and validate multiscale simulations. Lastly, we reviewed top-down and bottom-up multiscale strategies that integrate subcellular networks with the microenvironment. We present models of a variety of cancers, in addition to breast cancer specific models. Taken together, we expect as the sophistication of the simulations increase, that multiscale modeling and bottom-up agent-based models in particular will become an increasingly important platform technology for basic scientific discovery, as well as the identification and validation of potentially novel therapeutic targets.},

	Abstract = {By adding an additional degree of freedom from multichannel flow, the parallel microfluidic cytometer (PMC) combines some of the best features of fluorescence-activated flow cytometry (FCM) and microscope-based high-content screening (HCS). The PMC (i) lends itself to fast processing of large numbers of samples, (ii) adds a 1D imaging capability for intracellular localization assays (HCS), (iii) has a high rare-cell sensitivity, and (iv) has an unusual capability for time-synchronized sampling. An inability to practically handle large sample numbers has restricted applications of conventional flow cytometers and microscopes in combinatorial cell assays, network biology, and drug discovery. The PMC promises to relieve a bottleneck in these previously constrained applications. The PMC may also be a powerful tool for finding rare primary cells in the clinic. The multichannel architecture of current PMC prototypes allows 384 unique samples for a cell-based screen to be read out in ∼6-10 min, about 30 times the speed of most current FCM systems. In 1D intracellular imaging, the PMC can obtain protein localization using HCS marker strategies at many times for the sample throughput of charge-coupled device (CCD)-based microscopes or CCD-based single-channel flow cytometers. The PMC also permits the signal integration time to be varied over a larger range than is practical in conventional flow cytometers. The signal-to-noise advantages are useful, for example, in counting rare positive cells in the most difficult early stages of genome-wide screening. We review the status of parallel microfluidic cytometry and discuss some of the directions the new technology may take.},

	Abstract = {In pharmaceutical research, an adequate cell-based assay scheme to efficiently screen and to validate potential drug candidates in the initial stage of drug discovery is crucial. In order to better predict the clinical response to drug compounds, a cell culture model that is faithful to in vivo behavior is required. With the recent advances in microfluidic technology, the utilization of a microfluidic-based cell culture has several advantages, making it a promising alternative to the conventional cell culture methods. This review starts with a comprehensive discussion on the general process for drug discovery and development, the role of cell culture in drug research, and the characteristics of the cell culture formats commonly used in current microfluidic-based, cell-culture practices. Due to the significant differences in several physical phenomena between microscale and macroscale devices, microfluidic technology provides unique functionality, which is not previously possible by using traditional techniques. In a subsequent section, the niches for using microfluidic-based cell culture systems for drug research are discussed. Moreover, some critical issues such as cell immobilization, medium pumping or gradient generation in microfluidic-based, cell-culture systems are also reviewed. Finally, some practical applications of microfluidic-based, cell-culture systems in drug research particularly those pertaining to drug toxicity testing and those with a high-throughput capability are highlighted.},

	Abstract = {This review describes the use of high-throughput flow cytometry for performing multiplexed cell-based and bead-based screens. With the many advances in cell-based analysis and screening, flow cytometry has historically been underutilized as a screening tool largely due to the limitations in handling large numbers of samples. However, there has been a resurgence in the use of flow cytometry due to a combination of innovations around instrumentation and a growing need for cell-based and bead-based applications. The HTFC{\texttrademark} Screening System (IntelliCyt Corporation, Albuquerque, NM) is a novel flow cytometry-based screening platform that incorporates a fast sample-loading technology, HyperCyt{\textregistered}, with a two-laser, six-parameter flow cytometer and powerful data analysis capabilities. The system is capable of running multiplexed screening assays at speeds of up to 40 wells per minute, enabling the processing of a 96- and 384-well plates in as little as 3 and 12 min, respectively. Embedded in the system is HyperView{\textregistered}, a data analysis software package that allows rapid identification of hits from multiplexed high-throughput flow cytometry screening campaigns. In addition, the software is incorporated into a server-based data management platform that enables seamless data accessibility and collaboration across multiple sites. High-throughput flow cytometry using the HyperCyt technology has been applied to numerous assay areas and screening campaigns, including efflux transporters, whole cell and receptor binding assays, functional G-protein-coupled receptor screening, in vitro toxicology, and antibody screening.},

	Abstract = {Droplet microfluidics (DM) is an area of research which combines lab-on-a-chip (LOC) techniques with emulsion compartmentalization to perform high-throughput, chemical and biological assays. The key issue of this approach lies in the generation, over tens of milliseconds, of thousands of liquid vessels which can be used either as a carrier, to transport encapsulated particles and cells, or as microreactors, to perform parallel analysis of a vast number of samples. Each compartment comprises a liquid droplet containing the sample, surrounded by an immiscible fluid. This microfluidic technique is capable of generating subnanoliter and highly monodispersed liquid droplets, which offer many opportunities for developing novel single-cell and single-molecule studies, as well as high-throughput methodologies for the detection and sorting of encapsulated species in droplets. The aim of this chapter is to give an overview of the features of DM in a broad microfluidic context, as well as to show the advantages and limitations of the technology in the field of LOC analytical research. Examples are reported and discussed to show how DM can provide novel systems with applications in high-throughput, quantitative cell and particle analysis.},

@article{Kunz-Schughart2004,
	Abstract = {Over the past few years, establishment and adaptation of cell-based assays for drug development and testing has become an important topic in high-throughput screening (HTS). Most new assays are designed to rapidly detect specific cellular effects reflecting action at various targets. However, although more complex than cell-free biochemical test systems, HTS assays using monolayer or suspension cultures still reflect a highly artificial cellular environment and may thus have limited predictive value for the clinical efficacy of a compound. Today's strategies for drug discovery and development, be they hypothesis free or mechanism based, require facile, HTS-amenable test systems that mimic the human tissue environment with increasing accuracy in order to optimize preclinical and preanimal selection of the most active molecules from a large pool of potential effectors, for example, against solid tumors. Indeed, it is recognized that 3-dimensional cell culture systems better reflect the in vivo behavior of most cell types. However, these 3-D test systems have not yet been incorporated into mainstream drug development operations. This article addresses the relevance and potential of 3-D in vitro systems for drug development, with a focus on screening for novel antitumor drugs. Examples of 3-D cell models used in cancer research are given, and the advantages and limitations of these systems of intermediate complexity are discussed in comparison with both 2-D culture and in vivo models. The most commonly used 3-D cell culture systems, multicellular spheroids, are emphasized due to their advantages and potential for rapid development as HTS systems. Thus, multicellular tumor spheroids are an ideal basis for the next step in creating HTS assays, which are predictive of in vivo antitumor efficacy.},

	Abstract = {In vitro screening systems based on the coupled transcription and translation of genes using cell-free systems have a number of attractive features for protein engineering and directed evolution. We present a completely in vitro ultrahigh-throughput screening platform using droplet-based microfluidics. Single genes are compartmentalized in aqueous droplets, dispersed in inert carrier oil, and amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). After amplification, the droplets, now containing 30,000 copies of each gene, are fused one-to-one with droplets containing a cell-free coupled transcription-translation (IVTT) system and the reagents for a fluorogenic assay. Fluorescence-activated electrocoalescence with an aqueous stream is then used to selectively recover genes from droplets containing the desired activity. We demonstrate, by selecting mixtures of lacZ genes encoding the enzyme β-galactosidase and lacZmut genes encoding an inactive variant, that this system can sort at 2000 droplets s(-1): lacZ genes were enriched 502-fold from a 1 : 100 molar ratio of lacZ : lacZmut genes. Indeed, the false positive and false negative error rates were both <0.004 and the results indicate that enrichment is not limited by the sorting efficiency, but by the co-encapsulation of multiple genes in droplets, which is described by the Poisson distribution. Compared to screening using microtiter plate-based systems, the volume and cost of PCR and IVTT reagents are reduced by almost 10(5)-fold, allowing the screening of 10(6) genes using only 150 μL of reagents.},

	Abstract = {The explosive growth in our knowledge of genomes, proteomes, and metabolomes is driving ever-increasing fundamental understanding of the biochemistry of life, enabling qualitatively new studies of complex biological systems and their evolution. This knowledge also drives modern biotechnologies, such as molecular engineering and synthetic biology, which have enormous potential to address urgent problems, including developing potent new drugs and providing environmentally friendly energy. Many of these studies, however, are ultimately limited by their need for even-higher-throughput measurements of biochemical reactions. We present a general ultrahigh-throughput screening platform using drop-based microfluidics that overcomes these limitations and revolutionizes both the scale and speed of screening. We use aqueous drops dispersed in oil as picoliter-volume reaction vessels and screen them at rates of thousands per second. To demonstrate its power, we apply the system to directed evolution, identifying new mutants of the enzyme horseradish peroxidase exhibiting catalytic rates more than 10 times faster than their parent, which is already a very efficient enzyme. We exploit the ultrahigh throughput to use an initial purifying selection that removes inactive mutants; we identify approximately 100 variants comparable in activity to the parent from an initial population of approximately 10(7). After a second generation of mutagenesis and high-stringency screening, we identify several significantly improved mutants, some approaching diffusion-limited efficiency. In total, we screen approximately 10(8) individual enzyme reactions in only 10 h, using < 150 microL of total reagent volume; compared to state-of-the-art robotic screening systems, we perform the entire assay with a 1,000-fold increase in speed and a 1-million-fold reduction in cost.},

However, its success depends heavily on the efficiency of the screening strategy employed. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for screening enzyme libraries due to its high sensitivity and its ability to analyze as many as 10(8) mutants per day. Applications of FACS screening have allowed the isolation of enzyme variants with significantly improved activities, altered substrate specificities, or even novel functions. This review discusses FACS-based screening for enzymatic activity and its potential application for the directed evolution of enzymes, ribozymes, and catalytic antibodies.},

Novel bead-based assay systems allow studies of real-time interactions between solubilized receptors, ligands and molecular signaling components that recapitulate and extend measurements in intact cells.

	Abstract = {Human cancer cell lines grown in vitro are frequently used to decipher basic cell biological phenomena and to also specifically study different forms of cancer. Here we present the first large-scale study of protein expression patterns in cell lines using an antibody-based proteomics approach. We analyzed the expression pattern of 5436 proteins in 45 different cell lines using hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis, and two-group comparisons for the identification of differentially expressed proteins. Our results show that immunohistochemically determined protein profiles can categorize cell lines into groups that overall reflect the tumor tissue of origin and that hematological cell lines appear to retain their protein profiles to a higher degree than cell lines established from solid tumors. The two-group comparisons reveal well-characterized proteins as well as previously unstudied proteins that could be of potential interest for further investigations. Moreover, multiple myeloma cells and cells of myeloid origin were found to share a protein profile, relative to the protein profile of lymphoid leukemia and lymphoma cells, possibly reflecting their common dependency of bone marrow microenvironment. This work also provides an extensive list of antibodies, for which high-resolution images as well as validation data are available on the Human Protein Atlas ( www.proteinatlas.org ), that are of potential use in cell line studies.},

	Abstract = {The systematic translation of cancer genomic data into knowledge of tumour biology and therapeutic possibilities remains challenging. Such efforts should be greatly aided by robust preclinical model systems that reflect the genomic diversity of human cancers and for which detailed genetic and pharmacological annotation is available. Here we describe the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE): a compilation of gene expression, chromosomal copy number and massively parallel sequencing data from 947 human cancer cell lines. When coupled with pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of the cell lines, this collection allowed identification of genetic, lineage, and gene-expression-based predictors of drug sensitivity. In addition to known predictors, we found that plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to IGF1 receptor inhibitors; AHR expression was associated with MEK inhibitor efficacy in NRAS-mutant lines; and SLFN11 expression predicted sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors.

	Abstract = {The disparate response of leukemia cells to chemotherapy in vivo, compared to in vitro, is partly related to the interaction of leukemic cells and the three-dimensional bone marrow stromal microenvironment. We investigated the effects of chemotherapy agents on leukemic cell lines co-cultured with human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hu-BM-MSCs) in a three-dimensional model (3D). Comparison was made to leukemic cells treated in suspension, or grown on a hu-BM-MSC monolayer (2D conditions). We demonstrated that leukemic cells cultured in 3D were more resistant to drug-induced apoptosis compared to cells cultured in 2D or in suspension. We also demonstrated significant differences in leukemic cell response to chemotherapy using different leukemic cell lines cultured in 3D. We suggest that the differential responses to chemotherapy in 3D may be related to the expression of N-cadherin in the co-culture system. This unique model provides an opportunity to study leukemic cell responses to chemotherapy in 3D.},

These so-called organoids recapitulate the three-dimensional architecture of the gut epithelium, and consist of all major intestinal cell types. One key advantage of these ex vivo cultures is their accessibility to live imaging. So far the establishment of transgenic fluorescent reporter organoids has required the generation of transgenic mice, a laborious and time-consuming process, which cannot be extended to human cultures. Here we present a transfection protocol that enables the generation of recombinant mouse and human reporter organoids using BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) technology.},

Single sorted Lgr5(+) stem cells can also initiate these cryptvillus organoids. Tracing experiments indicate that the Lgr5(+) stem-cell hierarchy is maintained in organoids.

Here, we describe a comprehensive genomic analysis of 101 melanoma short-term cultures and cell lines. Using an analytic approach designed to enrich for putative "driver" events, we show that cultured melanoma cells encompass the spectrum of significant genomic alterations present in primary tumors. When annotated according to these lesions, melanomas cluster into subgroups suggestive of distinct oncogenic mechanisms. Integrating gene expression data suggests novel candidate effector genes linked to recurrent copy gains and losses, including both phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN)-dependent and PTEN-independent tumor suppressor mechanisms associated with chromosome 10 deletions. Finally, sample-matched pharmacologic data show that FGFR1 mutations and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation may modulate sensitivity to mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase inhibitors. Genetically defined cell culture collections therefore offer a rich framework for systematic functional studies in melanoma and other tumors.},

@article{Sos2009,
	Abstract = {Somatic genetic alterations in cancers have been linked with response to targeted therapeutics by creation of specific dependency on activated oncogenic signaling pathways. However, no tools currently exist to systematically connect such genetic lesions to therapeutic vulnerability. We have therefore developed a genomics approach to identify lesions associated with therapeutically relevant oncogene dependency. Using integrated genomic profiling, we have demonstrated that the genomes of a large panel of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines are highly representative of those of primary NSCLC tumors. Using cell-based compound screening coupled with diverse computational approaches to integrate orthogonal genomic and biochemical data sets, we identified molecular and genomic predictors of therapeutic response to clinically relevant compounds. Using this approach, we showed that v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations confer enhanced Hsp90 dependency and validated this finding in mice with KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma, as these mice exhibited dramatic tumor regression when treated with an Hsp90 inhibitor. In addition, we found that cells with copy number enhancement of v-abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ABL2) and ephrin receptor kinase and v-src sarcoma (Schmidt-Ruppin A-2) viral oncogene homolog (avian) (SRC) kinase family genes were exquisitely sensitive to treatment with the SRC/ABL inhibitor dasatinib, both in vitro and when it xenografted into mice. Thus, genomically annotated cell-line collections may help translate cancer genomics information into clinical practice by defining critical pathway dependencies amenable to therapeutic inhibition.},

Our comparison of copy-number changes, mutations and mRNA expression profiles reveals pronounced differences in molecular profiles between commonly used ovarian cancer cell lines and high-grade serous ovarian cancer tumour samples. We identify several rarely used cell lines that more closely resemble cognate tumour profiles than commonly used cell lines, and we propose these lines as the most suitable models of ovarian cancer.

The KG-1 cell line is composed predominantly of myeloblasts and promyelocytes. A unique characteristic of the KG-1 cells is their almost complete dependence on colony-stimulating factor for proliferation in soft-gel culture. The HL-60 is a promyelocytic leukemia cell line. In the presence of DMSO, the cells mature into granulocytes. Both the KG-1 and HL-60 cells differentiate into nondividing mononuclear phagocytes when exposed to phorbol esters.

@article{Nilsson1975,
	Abstract = {Over 200 established human hematopoietic cell lines of normal and malignant origin have been investigated by morphological and functional parameters. Employing morphology as the overriding parameter four types of lines were identified. (1) Lymphoblastoid cell lines, derived from normal and neoplastic hematopoietic tissue, were characterized by the wide morphologic flexibility of individual lymphoblastoid cells, constant association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), polyclonal derivation, differentiation for immunoglobulin production (secretion) and their diploids. (2) Lymphoma cell lines. This type of line was established at a high frequency from Burkitt's lymphoma and rarely from other types of lymphoma, but never from patients without malignancy or with non-lymphoma malignancies. Important characteristics were morphologic stereotypia within each line, monoclonal derivation, common but not obligatory association with EBV, variability in the expression of Ig synthesis (no production, or membrane bound Ig, or secretion) and aneuploidy. (3) Myeloma cell lines could only rarely be obtained from patients with myeloma. The basis for classification of these lines is their production of Ig identical to the myeloma protein in vitro. Other important distinguishing features were: plasma cell morphology, absence of EBV and aneuploidy. (4) The leukemia cell line (MOLT 4) was the only line with T-cell characteristics and was easily distinguished from the other types. Important characteristics were a typical surface ultrastructure, absence of EBV and absence of immunoglobulin production, Individual lymphoblastoid lines were in principle identical whereas each line of the other three types had its own characteristic profile. The phenotypic characteristics of the lymphoblastoid lines were very stable during prolonged serial cultivation. Only in a few cases were secondary chromosomal, functional or morphologic alterations noted. We conclude that EBV-carrying lymphoblastoid lines can be obtained from non-neoplastic precursor cells from healthy as well as from diseased individuals. Lymphoma, myeloma and leukemia lines are only obtained from the respective neoplastic tissue but generally at a low frequency. With the exception of Burkitt's lymphoma, malignant hematopoietic tissue and leukemia frequently give rise to established cell lines in vitro of the lymphoblastoid type rather than lines derived from the neoplastic cells;},

HeLa cells were used by researchers around the world. However, 20 years after Henrietta Lacks' death, mounting evidence suggested that HeLa cells contaminated and overgrew other cell lines. Cultures, supposedly of tissues such as breast cancer or mouse, proved to be HeLa cells. We describe the history behind the development of HeLa cells, including the first published description of Ms Lacks' autopsy, and the cell culture contamination that resulted. The debate over cell culture contamination began in the 1970s and was not harmonious. Ultimately, the problem was not resolved and it continues today. Finally, we discuss the philosophical implications of the immortal HeLa cell line.},

	Abstract = {UNLABELLED: All successful cancer therapies are limited by the development of drug resistance. The increase in the understanding of the molecular and biochemical bases of drug efficacy has also facilitated studies elucidating the mechanism(s) of drug resistance. Experimental approaches that can help predict the eventual clinical drug resistance, coupled with the evolution of systematic genomic and proteomic technologies, are rapidly identifying novel resistance mechanisms. In this review, we provide a historical background on drug resistance and a framework for understanding the common ways by which cancers develop resistance to targeted therapies. We further discuss advantages and disadvantages of experimental strategies that can be used to identify drug resistance mechanism(s).
SIGNIFICANCE: Increased knowledge of drug resistance mechanisms will aid in the development of effective therapies for patients with cancer. We provide a summary of current knowledge on drug resistance mechanisms and experimental strategies to identify and study additional drug resistance pathways.},

The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},

	Abstract = {Targeted therapeutics hold tremendous promise in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation. However, targeting proteins individually can be compensated for by bypass mechanisms and activation of regulatory loops. Designing optimal therapeutic combinations must therefore take into consideration the complex dynamic networks in the cell. In this study, we analyzed the insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) signaling network in the MDA-MB231 breast cancer cell line. We used reverse-phase protein array to measure the transient changes in the phosphorylation of proteins after IGF-1 stimulation. We developed a computational procedure that integrated mass action modeling with particle swarm optimization to train the model against the experimental data and infer the unknown model parameters. The trained model was used to predict how targeting individual signaling proteins altered the rest of the network and identify drug combinations that minimally increased phosphorylation of other proteins elsewhere in the network. Experimental testing of the modeling predictions showed that optimal drug combinations inhibited cell signaling and proliferation, whereas nonoptimal combination of inhibitors increased phosphorylation of nontargeted proteins and rescued cells from cell death. The integrative approach described here is useful for generating experimental intervention strategies that could optimize drug combinations and discover novel pharmacologic targets for cancer therapy.},

Using targeted inhibition of oncogenic signaling pathways, combined with DNA-damaging chemotherapy, we report that time-staggered EGFR inhibition, but not simultaneous coadministration, dramatically sensitizes a subset of triple-negative breast cancer cells to genotoxic drugs. Systems-level analysis-using high-density time-dependent measurements of signaling networks, gene expression profiles, and cell phenotypic responses in combination with mathematical modeling-revealed an approach for altering the intrinsic state of the cell through dynamic rewiring of oncogenic signaling pathways. This process converts these cells to a less tumorigenic state that is more susceptible to DNA damage-induced cell death by reactivation of an extrinsic apoptotic pathway whose function is suppressed in the oncogene-addicted state.},

However, often only specific combinations of inhibitors are effective. Therefore, the prediction of potent combinatorial treatments is a major challenge in targeted cancer therapy. In this study, we demonstrate how a model-based evaluation of signaling data can assist in finding the most suitable treatment combination. We generated a perturbation data set by monitoring the response of RAS/PI3K signaling to combined stimulations and inhibitions in a panel of colorectal cancer cell lines, which we analyzed using mathematical models. We detected that a negative feedback involving EGFR mediates strong cross talk from ERK to AKT. Consequently, when inhibiting MAPK, AKT activity is increased in an EGFR-dependent manner. Using the model, we predict that in contrast to single inhibition, combined inactivation of MEK and EGFR could inactivate both endpoints of RAS, ERK and AKT. We further could demonstrate that this combination blocked cell growth in BRAF- as well as KRAS-mutated tumor cells, which we confirmed using a xenograft model.},

	Abstract = {Crosstalk and compensatory circuits within cancer signaling networks limit the activity of most targeted therapies. For example, altered signaling in the networks activated by the ErbB family of receptors, particularly in ERBB2-amplified cancers, contributes to drug resistance. We developed a multiscale systems model of signaling networks in ERBB2-amplified breast cancer to quantitatively investigate relationships between biomarkers (markers of network activity) and combination drug efficacy. This model linked ErbB receptor family signaling to breast tumor growth through two kinase cascades: the PI3K/AKT survival pathway and the Ras/MEK/ERK growth and proliferation pathway. The model predicted molecular mechanisms of resistance to individual therapeutics. In particular, ERBB2-amplified breast cancer cells stimulated with the ErbB3 ligand heregulin were resistant to growth arrest induced by inhibitors of AKT and MEK or coapplication of two inhibitors of the receptor ErbB2 [Herceptin (trastuzumab) and Tykerb (lapatinib)]. We used model simulations to predict the response of ErbB2-positive breast cancer xenografts to combination therapies and verified these predictions in mice. Treatment with trastuzumab, lapatinib, and the ErbB3 inhibitor MM-111 was more effective in inhibiting tumor growth than the combination of AKT and MEK inhibitors and even induced tumor regression, indicating that targeting both ErbB3 and ErbB2 may be an improved therapeutic approach for ErbB2-positive breast cancer patients.},

	Abstract = {Androgen ablation therapy is currently the primary treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. Unfortunately, in nearly all cases, androgen ablation fails to permanently arrest cancer progression. As androgens like testosterone are withdrawn, prostate cancer cells lose their androgen sensitivity and begin to proliferate without hormone growth factors. In this study, we constructed and analyzed a mathematical model of the integration between hormone growth factor signaling, androgen receptor activation, and the expression of cyclin D and Prostate-Specific Antigen in human LNCaP prostate adenocarcinoma cells. The objective of the study was to investigate which signaling systems were important in the loss of androgen dependence. The model was formulated as a set of ordinary differential equations which described 212 species and 384 interactions, including both the mRNA and protein levels for key species. An ensemble approach was chosen to constrain model parameters and to estimate the impact of parametric uncertainty on model predictions. Model parameters were identified using 14 steady-state and dynamic LNCaP data sets taken from literature sources. Alterations in the rate of Prostatic Acid Phosphatase expression was sufficient to capture varying levels of androgen dependence. Analysis of the model provided insight into the importance of network components as a function of androgen dependence. The importance of androgen receptor availability and the MAPK/Akt signaling axes was independent of androgen status. Interestingly, androgen receptor availability was important even in androgen-independent LNCaP cells. Translation became progressively more important in androgen-independent LNCaP cells. Further analysis suggested a positive synergy between the MAPK and Akt signaling axes and the translation of key proliferative markers like cyclin D in androgen-independent cells. Taken together, the results support the targeting of both the Akt and MAPK pathways. Moreover, the analysis suggested that direct targeting of the translational machinery, specifically eIF4E, could be efficacious in androgen-independent prostate cancers.},

	Abstract = {The Wnt and the extracellular signal regulated-kinase (ERK) pathways are both involved in the pathogenesis of various kinds of cancers. Recently, the existence of crosstalk between Wnt and ERK pathways was reported. Gathering all reported results, we have discovered a positive feedback loop embedded in the crosstalk between the Wnt and ERK pathways. We have developed a plausible model that represents the role of this hidden positive feedback loop in the Wnt/ERK pathway crosstalk based on the integration of experimental reports and employing established basic mathematical models of each pathway. Our analysis shows that the positive feedback loop can generate bistability in both the Wnt and ERK signaling pathways, and this prediction was further validated by experiments. In particular, using the commonly accepted assumption that mutations in signaling proteins contribute to cancerogenesis, we have found two conditions through which mutations could evoke an irreversible response leading to a sustained activation of both pathways. One condition is enhanced production of beta-catenin, the other is a reduction of the velocity of MAP kinase phosphatase(s). This enables that high activities of Wnt and ERK pathways are maintained even without a persistent extracellular signal. Thus, our study adds a novel aspect to the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis by showing that mutational changes in individual proteins can cause fundamental functional changes well beyond the pathway they function in by a positive feedback loop embedded in crosstalk. Thus, crosstalk between signaling pathways provides a vehicle through which mutations of individual components can affect properties of the system at a larger scale.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The luminal surface of the gut is lined with a monolayer of epithelial cells that acts as a nutrient absorptive engine and protective barrier. To maintain its integrity and functionality, the epithelium is renewed every few days. Theoretical models are powerful tools that can be used to test hypotheses concerning the regulation of this renewal process, to investigate how its dysfunction can lead to loss of homeostasis and neoplasia, and to identify potential therapeutic interventions. Here we propose a new multiscale model for crypt dynamics that links phenomena occurring at the subcellular, cellular and tissue levels of organisation.
METHODS: At the subcellular level, deterministic models characterise molecular networks, such as cell-cycle control and Wnt signalling. The output of these models determines the behaviour of each epithelial cell in response to intra-, inter- and extracellular cues. The modular nature of the model enables us to easily modify individual assumptions and analyse their effects on the system as a whole.
RESULTS: We perform virtual microdissection and labelling-index experiments, evaluate the impact of various model extensions, obtain new insight into clonal expansion in the crypt, and compare our predictions with recent mitochondrial DNA mutation data.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that relaxing the assumption that stem-cell positions are fixed enables clonal expansion and niche succession to occur. We also predict that the presence of extracellular factors near the base of the crypt alone suffices to explain the observed spatial variation in nuclear beta-catenin levels along the crypt axis.},

	Abstract = {Wnt signalling is involved in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes. The presence of an extracellular Wnt stimulus induces cytoplasmic stabilisation and nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, a protein that also plays an essential role in cadherin-mediated adhesion. Two main hypotheses have been proposed concerning the balance between beta-catenin's adhesive and transcriptional functions: either beta-catenin's fate is determined by competition between its binding partners, or Wnt induces folding of beta-catenin into a conformation allocated preferentially to transcription. The experimental data supporting each hypotheses remain inconclusive. In this paper we present a new mathematical model of the Wnt pathway that incorporates beta-catenin's dual function. We use this model to carry out a series of in silico experiments and compare the behaviour of systems governed by each hypothesis. Our analytical results and model simulations provide further insight into the current understanding of Wnt signalling and, in particular, reveal differences in the response of the two modes of interaction between adhesion and signalling in certain in silico settings. We also exploit our model to investigate the impact of the mutations most commonly observed in human colorectal cancer. Simulations show that the amount of functional APC required to maintain a normal phenotype increases with increasing strength of the Wnt signal, a result which illustrates that the environment can substantially influence both tumour initiation and phenotype.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The amplification of signals, defined as an increase in the intensity of a signal through networks of intracellular reactions, is considered one of the essential properties in many cell signalling pathways. Despite of the apparent importance of signal amplification, there have been few attempts to formalise this concept.
RESULTS: In this work we investigate the amplification and responsiveness of the JAK2-STAT5 pathway using a kinetic model. The recruitment of EpoR to the plasma membrane, activation by Epo, and deactivation of the EpoR/JAK2 complex are considered as well as the activation and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of STAT5. Using qualitative biological knowledge, we first establish the structure of a general power-law model. We then generate a family of models from which we select suitable candidates. The parameter values of the model are estimated from experimental quantitative time-course data. The final model, whether it is conventional model with fixed predefined integer kinetic orders or a model with variable non-integer kinetic orders, is selected on the basis of a good agreement between simulations and the experimental data. The model is used to analyse the responsiveness and amplification properties of the pathway with sustained, transient, and oscillatory stimulation.
CONCLUSION: The selected kinetic model predicts that the system acts as an amplifier with maximum amplification and sensitivity for input signals whose intensity match physiological values for Epo concentration and with duration in the range of one to 100 minutes. The response of the system reaches saturation for more intense and longer stimulation with Epo. We hypothesise that these properties of the system directly relate to the saturation of Epo receptor activation, its low recruitment to the plasma membrane and intense deactivation as predicted by the model.},

	Abstract = {Considerable progress has been made in identifying the molecular composition of complex signaling networks controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. However, to discover general building principles and predict the dynamic behavior of signaling networks, it is necessary to develop quantitative models based on experimental observations. Here we report a mathematical model of the core module of the Janus family of kinases (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway based on time-resolved measurements of receptor and STAT5 phosphorylation. Applying the fitted model, we can determine the quantitative behavior of STAT5 populations not accessible to experimental measurement. By in silico investigations, we identify the parameters of nuclear shuttling as the most sensitive to perturbations and verify experimentally the model prediction that inhibition of nuclear export results in a reduced transcriptional yield. The model reveals that STAT5 undergoes rapid nucleocytoplasmic cycles, continuously coupling receptor activation and target gene transcription, thereby forming a remote sensor between nucleus and receptor. Thus, dynamic modeling of signaling pathways can promote functional understanding at the systems level.},

	Abstract = {The ErbB signaling pathways, which regulate diverse physiological responses such as cell survival, proliferation and motility, have been subjected to extensive molecular analysis. Nonetheless, it remains poorly understood how different ligands induce different responses and how this is affected by oncogenic mutations. To quantify signal flow through ErbB-activated pathways we have constructed, trained and analyzed a mass action model of immediate-early signaling involving ErbB1-4 receptors (EGFR, HER2/Neu2, ErbB3 and ErbB4), and the MAPK and PI3K/Akt cascades. We find that parameter sensitivity is strongly dependent on the feature (e.g. ERK or Akt activation) or condition (e.g. EGF or heregulin stimulation) under examination and that this context dependence is informative with respect to mechanisms of signal propagation. Modeling predicts log-linear amplification so that significant ERK and Akt activation is observed at ligand concentrations far below the K(d) for receptor binding. However, MAPK and Akt modules isolated from the ErbB model continue to exhibit switch-like responses. Thus, key system-wide features of ErbB signaling arise from nonlinear interaction among signaling elements, the properties of which appear quite different in context and in isolation.},

	Abstract = {Crosstalk mechanisms have not been studied as thoroughly as individual signaling pathways. We exploit experimental and computational approaches to reveal how a concordant interplay between the insulin and epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling networks can potentiate mitogenic signaling. In HEK293 cells, insulin is a poor activator of the Ras/ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) cascade, yet it enhances ERK activation by low EGF doses. We find that major crosstalk mechanisms that amplify ERK signaling are localized upstream of Ras and at the Ras/Raf level. Computational modeling unveils how critical network nodes, the adaptor proteins GAB1 and insulin receptor substrate (IRS), Src kinase, and phosphatase SHP2, convert insulin-induced increase in the phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP(3)) concentration into enhanced Ras/ERK activity. The model predicts and experiments confirm that insulin-induced amplification of mitogenic signaling is abolished by disrupting PIP(3)-mediated positive feedback via GAB1 and IRS. We demonstrate that GAB1 behaves as a non-linear amplifier of mitogenic responses and insulin endows EGF signaling with robustness to GAB1 suppression. Our results show the feasibility of using computational models to identify key target combinations and predict complex cellular responses to a mixture of external cues.},

	Abstract = {Intracellular signaling networks receive and process information to control cellular machines. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1,2/protein kinase C (PKC) system is one such network that regulates many cellular machines, including the cell cycle machinery and autocrine/paracrine factor synthesizing machinery. We used a combination of computational analysis and experiments in mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblasts to understand the design principles of this controller network. We find that the growth factor-stimulated signaling network containing MAPK 1, 2/PKC can operate with one (monostable) or two (bistable) stable states. At low concentrations of MAPK phosphatase, the system exhibits bistable behavior, such that brief stimulus results in sustained MAPK activation. The MAPK-induced increase in the amounts of MAPK phosphatase eliminates the prolonged response capability and moves the network to a monostable state, in which it behaves as a proportional response system responding acutely to stimulus. Thus, the MAPK 1, 2/PKC controller network is flexibly designed, and MAPK phosphatase may be critical for this flexible response.},

	Abstract = {Activation of effector caspases is a final step during apoptosis. Single-cell imaging studies have demonstrated that this process may occur as a rapid, all-or-none response, triggering a complete substrate cleavage within 15 min. Based on biochemical data from HeLa cells, we have developed a computational model of apoptosome-dependent caspase activation that was sufficient to remodel the rapid kinetics of effector caspase activation observed in vivo. Sensitivity analyses predicted a critical role for caspase-3-dependent feedback signalling and the X-linked-inhibitor-of-apoptosis-protein (XIAP), but a less prominent role for the XIAP antagonist Smac. Single-cell experiments employing a caspase fluorescence resonance energy transfer substrate verified these model predictions qualitatively and quantitatively. XIAP was predicted to control this all-or-none response, with concentrations as high as 0.15 microM enabling, but concentrations >0.30 microM significantly blocking substrate cleavage. Overexpression of XIAP within these threshold concentrations produced cells showing slow effector caspase activation and submaximal substrate cleavage. Our study supports the hypothesis that high levels of XIAP control caspase activation and substrate cleavage, and may promote apoptosis resistance and sublethal caspase activation in vivo.},

	Abstract = {p53 is activated in response to events compromising the genetic integrity of a cell. Recent data show that p53 activity does not increase steadily with genetic damage but rather fluctuates in an oscillatory fashion. Theoretical studies suggest that oscillations can arise from a combination of positive and negative feedbacks or from a long negative feedback loop alone. Both negative and positive feedbacks are present in the p53/Mdm2 network, but it is not known what roles they play in the oscillatory response to DNA damage. We developed a mathematical model of p53 oscillations based on positive and negative feedbacks in the p53/Mdm2 network. According to the model, the system reacts to DNA damage by moving from a stable steady state into a region of stable limit cycles. Oscillations in the model are born with large amplitude, which guarantees an all-or-none response to damage. As p53 oscillates, damage is repaired and the system moves back to a stable steady state with low p53 activity. The model reproduces experimental data in quantitative detail. We suggest new experiments for dissecting the contributions of negative and positive feedbacks to the generation of oscillations.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most of the modeling performed in the area of systems biology aims at achieving a quantitative description of the intracellular pathways within a "typical cell". However, in many biologically important situations even clonal cell populations can show a heterogeneous response. These situations require study of cell-to-cell variability and the development of models for heterogeneous cell populations.
RESULTS: In this paper we consider cell populations in which the dynamics of every single cell is captured by a parameter dependent differential equation. Differences among cells are modeled by differences in parameters which are subject to a probability density. A novel Bayesian approach is presented to infer this probability density from population snapshot data, such as flow cytometric analysis, which do not provide single cell time series data. The presented approach can deal with sparse and noisy measurement data. Furthermore, it is appealing from an application point of view as in contrast to other methods the uncertainty of the resulting parameter distribution can directly be assessed.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method is evaluated using artificial experimental data from a model of the tumor necrosis factor signaling network. We demonstrate that the methods are computationally efficient and yield good estimation result even for sparse data sets.},

	Abstract = {The canonical nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway controls a gene network important in the cellular inflammatory response. Upon activation, NF-κB/RelA is released from cytoplasmic inhibitors, from where it translocates into the nucleus, subsequently activating negative feedback loops producing either monophasic or damped oscillatory nucleo-cytoplasmic dynamics. Although the population behavior of the NF-κB pathway has been extensively modeled, the sources of cell-to-cell variability are not well understood. We describe an integrated experimental-computational analysis of NF-κB/RelA translocation in a validated cell model exhibiting monophasic dynamics. Quantitative measures of cellular geometry and total cytoplasmic concentration and translocated RelA amounts were used as priors in Bayesian inference to estimate biophysically realistic parameter values based on dynamic live cell imaging studies of enhanced GFP-tagged RelA in stable transfectants. Bayesian inference was performed on multiple cells simultaneously, assuming identical reaction rate parameters, whereas cellular geometry and initial and total NF-κB concentration-related parameters were cell-specific. A subpopulation of cells exhibiting distinct kinetic profiles was identified that corresponded to differences in the IκBα translation rate. We conclude that cellular geometry, initial and total NF-κB concentration, IκBα translation, and IκBα degradation rates account for distinct cell-to-cell differences in canonical NF-κB translocation dynamics.},

	Abstract = {The role of mechanistic modeling and systems biology in molecular medicine remains unclear. In this study, we explored whether uncertain models could be used to understand how a network responds to a therapeutic intervention. As a proof of concept, we modeled and analyzed the response of the human coagulation cascade to recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) and prothrombin (fII) addition in normal and hemophilic plasma. An ensemble of parametrically uncertain human coagulation models was developed (N = 437). Each model described the time evolution of 193 proteins and protein complexes interconnected by 301 interactions under quiescent flow. The 467 unknown model parameters were estimated, using multiobjective optimization, from published in vitro coagulation studies. The model ensemble was validated using published in vitro thrombin measurements and thrombin measurements taken from coronary artery disease patients. Sensitivity analysis was then used to rank-order the importance of model parameters as a function of experimental or physiological conditions. A novel strategy for the systematic comparison of ranks identified a family of fX/FXa and fII/FIIa interactions that became more sensitive with decreasing fVIII/fIX. The fragility of these interactions was preserved following the addition of exogenous rFVIIa and fII. This suggested that exogenous rFVIIa did not alter the qualitative operation of the cascade. Rather, exogenous rFVIIa and fII took advantage of existing fluid and interfacial fX/FXa and fII/FIIa sensitivity to restore normal coagulation in low fVIII/fIX conditions. The proposed rFVIIa mechanism of action was consistent with experimental literature not used in model training. Thus, we demonstrated that an ensemble of uncertain models could unravel key facets of the mechanism of action of a focused intervention. Whereas the current study was limited to coagulation, perhaps the general strategy used could be extended to other molecular networks relevant to human health.},

@article{Lequieu2011,
	Abstract = {Insulin, the primary hormone regulating the level of glucose in the bloodstream, modulates a variety of cellular and enzymatic processes in normal and diseased cells. Insulin signals are processed by a complex network of biochemical interactions which ultimately induce gene expression programs or other processes such as translation initiation. Surprisingly, despite the wealth of literature on insulin signaling, the relative importance of the components linking insulin with translation initiation remains unclear. We addressed this question by developing and interrogating a family of mathematical models of insulin induced translation initiation. The insulin network was modeled using mass-action kinetics within an ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework. A family of model parameters was estimated, starting from an initial best fit parameter set, using 24 experimental data sets taken from literature. The residual between model simulations and each of the experimental constraints were simultaneously minimized using multiobjective optimization. Interrogation of the model population, using sensitivity and robustness analysis, identified an insulin-dependent switch that controlled translation initiation. Our analysis suggested that without insulin, a balance between the pro-initiation activity of the GTP-binding protein Rheb and anti-initiation activity of PTEN controlled basal initiation. On the other hand, in the presence of insulin a combination of PI3K and Rheb activity controlled inducible initiation, where PI3K was only critical in the presence of insulin. Other well known regulatory mechanisms governing insulin action, for example IRS-1 negative feedback, modulated the relative importance of PI3K and Rheb but did not fundamentally change the signal flow.},

@article{Song2010,
	Abstract = {Mathematical modeling of complex gene expression programs is an emerging tool for understanding disease mechanisms. However, identification of large models sometimes requires training using qualitative, conflicting or even contradictory data sets. One strategy to address this challenge is to estimate experimentally constrained model ensembles using multiobjective optimization. In this study, we used Pareto Optimal Ensemble Techniques (POETs) to identify a family of proof-of-concept signal transduction models. POETs integrate Simulated Annealing (SA) with Pareto optimality to identify models near the optimal tradeoff surface between competing training objectives. We modeled a prototypical-signaling network using mass-action kinetics within an ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework (64 ODEs in total). The true model was used to generate synthetic immunoblots from which the POET algorithm identified the 117 unknown model parameters. POET generated an ensemble of signaling models, which collectively exhibited population-like behavior. For example, scaled gene expression levels were approximately normally distributed over the ensemble following the addition of extracellular ligand. Also, the ensemble recovered robust and fragile features of the true model, despite significant parameter uncertainty. Taken together, these results suggest that experimentally constrained model ensembles could capture qualitatively important network features without exact parameter information.},

Much recent work on robustness and evolvability has focused on the structure of neutral spaces, in which system behavior remains invariant to mutations. Recently we have shown that the collective behavior of multiparameter models is most often sloppy: insensitive to changes except along a few 'stiff' combinations of parameters, with an enormous sloppy neutral subspace. Robustness is often assumed to be an emergent evolved property, but the sloppiness natural to biochemical networks offers an alternative nonadaptive explanation. Conversely, ideas developed to study evolvability in robust systems can be usefully extended to characterize sloppy systems.},

These models contain many unknown parameters, at least some of which are difficult to measure directly, and instead are estimated by fitting to time-course data. Previous work has suggested that even with precise data sets, many parameters are unknowable by trajectory measurements. We examined this question in the context of a pathway model of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and neuronal growth factor (NGF) signaling. Computationally, we examined a palette of experimental perturbations that included different doses of EGF and NGF as well as single and multiple gene knockdowns and overexpressions. While no single experiment could accurately estimate all of the parameters, experimental design methodology identified a set of five complementary experiments that could. These results suggest optimism for the prospects for calibrating even large models, that the success of parameter estimation is intimately linked to the experimental perturbations used, and that experimental design methodology is important for parameter fitting of biological models and likely for the accuracy that can be expected from them.},

	Abstract = {Advances in molecular biology provide an opportunity to develop detailed models of biological processes that can be used to obtain an integrated understanding of the system. However, development of useful models from the available knowledge of the system and experimental observations still remains a daunting task. In this work, a model identification strategy for complex biological networks is proposed. The approach includes a state regulator problem (SRP) that provides estimates of all the component concentrations and the reaction rates of the network using the available measurements. The full set of the estimates is utilised for model parameter identification for the network of known topology. An a priori model complexity test that indicates the feasibility of performance of the proposed algorithm is developed. Fisher information matrix (FIM) theory is used to address model identifiability issues. Two signalling pathway case studies, the caspase function in apoptosis and the MAP kinase cascade system, are considered. The MAP kinase cascade, with measurements restricted to protein complex concentrations, fails the a priori test and the SRP estimates are poor as expected. The apoptosis network structure used in this work has moderate complexity and is suitable for application of the proposed tools. Using a measurement set of seven protein concentrations, accurate estimates for all unknowns are obtained. Furthermore, the effects of measurement sampling frequency and quality of information in the measurement set on the performance of the identified model are described.},

@article{Huang2000,
	Abstract = {Development of characteristic tissue patterns requires that individual cells be switched locally between different phenotypes or "fates;" while one cell may proliferate, its neighbors may differentiate or die. Recent studies have revealed that local switching between these different gene programs is controlled through interplay between soluble growth factors, insoluble extracellular matrix molecules, and mechanical forces which produce cell shape distortion. Although the precise molecular basis remains unknown, shape-dependent control of cell growth and function appears to be mediated by tension-dependent changes in the actin cytoskeleton. However, the question remains: how can a generalized physical stimulus, such as cell distortion, activate the same set of genes and signaling proteins that are triggered by molecules which bind to specific cell surface receptors. In this article, we use computer simulations based on dynamic Boolean networks to show that the different cell fates that a particular cell can exhibit may represent a preprogrammed set of common end programs or "attractors" which self-organize within the cell's regulatory networks. In this type of dynamic network model of information processing, generalized stimuli (e.g., mechanical forces) and specific molecular cues elicit signals which follow different trajectories, but eventually converge onto one of a small set of common end programs (growth, quiescence, differentiation, apoptosis, etc.). In other words, if cells use this type of information processing system, then control of cell function would involve selection of preexisting (latent) behavioral modes of the cell, rather than instruction by specific binding molecules. Importantly, the results of the computer simulation closely mimic experimental data obtained with living endothelial cells. The major implication of this finding is that current methods used for analysis of cell function that rely on characterization of linear signaling pathways or clusters of genes with common activity profiles may overlook the most critical features of cellular information processing which normally determine how signal specificity is established and maintained in living cells.},

	Abstract = {Resistance to targeted cancer therapies such as trastuzumab is a frequent clinical problem not solely because of insufficient expression of HER2 receptor but also because of the overriding activation states of cell signaling pathways. Systems biology approaches lend themselves to rapid in silico testing of factors, which may confer resistance to targeted therapies. Inthis study, we aimed to develop a new kinetic model that could be interrogated to predict resistance to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor therapies and directly test predictions in vitro and in clinical samples. The new mathematical model included RTK inhibitor antibody binding, HER2/HER3 dimerization and inhibition, AKT/mitogen-activated protein kinase cross-talk, and the regulatory properties of PTEN. The model was parameterized using quantitative phosphoprotein expression data from cancer cell lines using reverse-phase protein microarrays. Quantitative PTEN protein expression was found to be the key determinant of resistance to anti-HER2 therapy in silico, which was predictive of unseen experiments in vitro using the PTEN inhibitor bp(V). When measured in cancer cell lines, PTEN expression predicts sensitivity to anti-HER2 therapy; furthermore, this quantitative measurement is more predictive of response (relative risk, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-5.5; P < 0.0001) than other pathway components taken in isolation and when tested by multivariate analysis in a cohort of 122 breast cancers treated with trastuzumab. For the first time, a systems biology approach has successfully been used to stratify patients for personalized therapy in cancer and is further compelling evidence that PTEN, appropriately measured in the clinical setting, refines clinical decision making in patients treated with anti-HER2 therapies.},

@article{Kumar2008,
	Abstract = {Small-molecule kinase inhibitors often modulate signaling pathways other than the one targeted, whether by direct "off-target" effects or by indirect "pathway cross-talk" effects. The presence of either or both of these classes of complicating factors impedes the predictive understanding of kinase inhibitor consequences for cell phenotypic behaviors involved in drug efficacy responses. To address this problem, we offer an avenue toward comprehending how kinase inhibitor modulations of cell signaling networks lead to altered cell phenotypic responses by applying a quantitative, multipathway computational modeling approach. We show that integrating measurements of signals across three key kinase pathways involved in regulating migration of human mammary epithelial cells, downstream of ErbB system receptor activation by epidermal growth factor (EGF) or heregulin (HRG), significantly improves prediction of cell migration changes resulting from treatment with the small-molecule inhibitors 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (LY294002) and 2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone (PD98059) for both normal and HER2-overexpressing cells. These inhibitors are primarily directed toward inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) but are known to exhibit off-target effects; moreover, complex cross-talk interactions between the PI3K/Akt and MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) pathways are also appreciated. We observe here that treatment with LY294002 reduces migration of HRG-stimulated cells but not EGF-stimulated cells, despite comparable levels of reduction of Akt phosphorylation under both conditions, demonstrating that the target inhibition effect is not unilaterally predictive of efficacy against cell phenotypic response. Consequent measurement of levels of Erk and p38 phosphorylation, along with those for EGF receptor phosphorylation, after LY294002 treatment revealed unintended modulation of these nontargeted pathways. However, when these measurements were incorporated into a partial least-squares regression model, the cell migration responses to treatment were successfully predicted. Similar success was found for the same multipathway model in analogously predicting PD98059 treatment effects on cell migration. We conclude that a quantitative, multipathway modeling approach can provide a significant advance toward comprehending kinase inhibitor efficacy in the face of off-target and pathway cross-talk effects.},

	Abstract = {We present a multiscale agent-based non-small cell lung cancer model that consists of a 3D environment with which cancer cells interact while processing phenotypic changes. At the molecular level, transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) has been integrated into our previously developed in silico model as a second extrinsic input in addition to epidermal growth factor (EGF). The main aim of this study is to investigate how the effects of individual and combinatorial change in EGF and TGFbeta concentrations at the molecular level alter tumor growth dynamics on the multi-cellular level, specifically tumor volume and expansion rate. Our simulation results show that separate EGF and TGFbeta fluctuations trigger competing multi-cellular phenotypes, yet synchronous EGF and TGFbeta signaling yields a spatially more aggressive tumor that overall exhibits an EGF-driven phenotype. By altering EGF and TGFbeta concentration levels simultaneously and asynchronously, we discovered a particular region of EGF-TGFbeta profiles that ensures phenotypic stability of the tumor system. Within this region, concentration changes in EGF and TGFbeta do not impact the resulting multi-cellular response substantially, while outside these concentration ranges, a change at the molecular level will substantially alter either tumor volume or tumor expansion rate, or both. By evaluating tumor growth dynamics across different scales, we show that, under certain conditions, therapeutic targeting of only one signaling pathway may be insufficient. Potential implications of these in silico results for future clinico-pharmacological applications are discussed.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently overexpressed in many cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In silico modeling is considered to be an increasingly promising tool to add useful insights into the dynamics of the EGFR signal transduction pathway. However, most of the previous modeling work focused on the molecular or the cellular level only, neglecting the crucial feedback between these scales as well as the interaction with the heterogeneous biochemical microenvironment.
RESULTS: We developed a multiscale model for investigating expansion dynamics of NSCLC within a two-dimensional in silico microenvironment. At the molecular level, a specific EGFR-ERK intracellular signal transduction pathway was implemented. Dynamical alterations of these molecules were used to trigger phenotypic changes at the cellular level. Examining the relationship between extrinsic ligand concentrations, intrinsic molecular profiles and microscopic patterns, the results confirmed that increasing the amount of available growth factor leads to a spatially more aggressive cancer system. Moreover, for the cell closest to nutrient abundance, a phase-transition emerges where a minimal increase in extrinsic ligand abolishes the proliferative phenotype altogether.
CONCLUSION: Our in silico results indicate that in NSCLC, in the presence of a strong extrinsic chemotactic stimulus (and depending on the cell's location) downstream EGFR-ERK signaling may be processed more efficiently, thereby yielding a migration-dominant cell phenotype and overall, an accelerated spatio-temporal expansion rate.},

	Abstract = {The desire to understand tumor complexity has given rise to mathematical models to describe the tumor microenvironment. We present a new mathematical model for avascular tumor growth and development that spans three distinct scales. At the cellular level, a lattice Monte Carlo model describes cellular dynamics (proliferation, adhesion, and viability). At the subcellular level, a Boolean network regulates the expression of proteins that control the cell cycle. At the extracellular level, reaction-diffusion equations describe the chemical dynamics (nutrient, waste, growth promoter, and inhibitor concentrations). Data from experiments with multicellular spheroids were used to determine the parameters of the simulations. Starting with a single tumor cell, this model produces an avascular tumor that quantitatively mimics experimental measurements in multicellular spheroids. Based on the simulations, we predict: 1), the microenvironmental conditions required for tumor cell survival; and 2), growth promoters and inhibitors have diffusion coefficients in the range between 10(-6) and 10(-7) cm2/h, corresponding to molecules of size 80-90 kDa. Using the same parameters, the model also accurately predicts spheroid growth curves under different external nutrient supply conditions.},

	Abstract = {Apoptosis in response to TRAIL or TNF requires the activation of initiator caspases, which then activate the effector caspases that dismantle cells and cause death. However, little is known about the dynamics and regulatory logic linking initiators and effectors. Using a combination of live-cell reporters, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting, we find that initiator caspases are active during the long and variable delay that precedes mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and effector caspase activation. When combined with a mathematical model of core apoptosis pathways, experimental perturbation of regulatory links between initiator and effector caspases reveals that XIAP and proteasome-dependent degradation of effector caspases are important in restraining activity during the pre-MOMP delay. We identify conditions in which restraint is impaired, creating a physiologically indeterminate state of partial cell death with the potential to generate genomic instability. Together, these findings provide a quantitative picture of caspase regulatory networks and their failure modes.},

@article{Albeck2008,
	Abstract = {When exposed to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a closely related death ligand and investigational therapeutic, cells enter a protracted period of variable duration in which only upstream initiator caspases are active. A subsequent and sudden transition marks activation of the downstream effector caspases that rapidly dismantle the cell. Thus, extrinsic apoptosis is controlled by an unusual variable-delay, snap-action switch that enforces an unambiguous choice between life and death. To understand how the extrinsic apoptosis switch functions in quantitative terms, we constructed a mathematical model based on a mass-action representation of known reaction pathways. The model was trained against experimental data obtained by live-cell imaging, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting of cells perturbed by protein depletion and overexpression. The trained model accurately reproduces the behavior of normal and perturbed cells exposed to TRAIL, making it possible to study switching mechanisms in detail. Model analysis shows, and experiments confirm, that the duration of the delay prior to effector caspase activation is determined by initiator caspase-8 activity and the rates of other reactions lying immediately downstream of the TRAIL receptor. Sudden activation of effector caspases is achieved downstream by reactions involved in permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane and relocalization of proteins such as Smac. We find that the pattern of interactions among Bcl-2 family members, the partitioning of Smac from its binding partner XIAP, and the mechanics of pore assembly are all critical for snap-action control.},

@article{Sahin2009,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: In breast cancer, overexpression of the transmembrane tyrosine kinase ERBB2 is an adverse prognostic marker, and occurs in almost 30% of the patients. For therapeutic intervention, ERBB2 is targeted by monoclonal antibody trastuzumab in adjuvant settings; however, de novo resistance to this antibody is still a serious issue, requiring the identification of additional targets to overcome resistance. In this study, we have combined computational simulations, experimental testing of simulation results, and finally reverse engineering of a protein interaction network to define potential therapeutic strategies for de novo trastuzumab resistant breast cancer.
RESULTS: First, we employed Boolean logic to model regulatory interactions and simulated single and multiple protein loss-of-functions. Then, our simulation results were tested experimentally by producing single and double knockdowns of the network components and measuring their effects on G1/S transition during cell cycle progression. Combinatorial targeting of ERBB2 and EGFR did not affect the response to trastuzumab in de novo resistant cells, which might be due to decoupling of receptor activation and cell cycle progression. Furthermore, examination of c-MYC in resistant as well as in sensitive cell lines, using a specific chemical inhibitor of c-MYC (alone or in combination with trastuzumab), demonstrated that both trastuzumab sensitive and resistant cells responded to c-MYC perturbation.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we connected ERBB signaling with G1/S transition of the cell cycle via two major cell signaling pathways and two key transcription factors, to model an interaction network that allows for the identification of novel targets in the treatment of trastuzumab resistant breast cancer. Applying this new strategy, we found that, in contrast to trastuzumab sensitive breast cancer cells, combinatorial targeting of ERBB receptors or of key signaling intermediates does not have potential for treatment of de novo trastuzumab resistant cells. Instead, c-MYC was identified as a novel potential target protein in breast cancer cells.},

In this paper we apply a fuzzy logic framework to the analysis of a large, systematic dataset describing the dynamics of cell signaling downstream of TNF, EGF, and insulin receptors in human colon carcinoma cells. Simulations based on fuzzy logic recapitulate most features of the data and generate several predictions involving pathway crosstalk and regulation. We uncover a relationship between MK2 and ERK pathways that might account for the previously identified pro-survival influence of MK2. We also find unexpected inhibition of IKK following EGF treatment, possibly due to down-regulation of autocrine signaling. More generally, fuzzy logic models are flexible, able to incorporate qualitative and noisy data, and powerful enough to produce quantitative predictions and new biological insights about the operation of signaling networks.},

	Abstract = {The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway is probably the best-studied receptor system in mammalian cells, and it also has become a popular example for employing mathematical modeling to cellular signaling networks. Dynamic models have the highest explanatory and predictive potential; however, the lack of kinetic information restricts current models of EGFR signaling to smaller sub-networks. This work aims to provide a large-scale qualitative model that comprises the main and also the side routes of EGFR/ErbB signaling and that still enables one to derive important functional properties and predictions. Using a recently introduced logical modeling framework, we first examined general topological properties and the qualitative stimulus-response behavior of the network. With species equivalence classes, we introduce a new technique for logical networks that reveals sets of nodes strongly coupled in their behavior. We also analyzed a model variant which explicitly accounts for uncertainties regarding the logical combination of signals in the model. The predictive power of this model is still high, indicating highly redundant sub-structures in the network. Finally, one key advance of this work is the introduction of new techniques for assessing high-throughput data with logical models (and their underlying interaction graph). By employing these techniques for phospho-proteomic data from primary hepatocytes and the HepG2 cell line, we demonstrate that our approach enables one to uncover inconsistencies between experimental results and our current qualitative knowledge and to generate new hypotheses and conclusions. Our results strongly suggest that the Rac/Cdc42 induced p38 and JNK cascades are independent of PI3K in both primary hepatocytes and HepG2. Furthermore, we detected that the activation of JNK in response to neuregulin follows a PI3K-dependent signaling pathway.},

	Abstract = {Cellular decisions are determined by complex molecular interaction networks. Large-scale signaling networks are currently being reconstructed, but the kinetic parameters and quantitative data that would allow for dynamic modeling are still scarce. Therefore, computational studies based upon the structure of these networks are of great interest. Here, a methodology relying on a logical formalism is applied to the functional analysis of the complex signaling network governing the activation of T cells via the T cell receptor, the CD4/CD8 co-receptors, and the accessory signaling receptor CD28. Our large-scale Boolean model, which comprises 94 nodes and 123 interactions and is based upon well-established qualitative knowledge from primary T cells, reveals important structural features (e.g., feedback loops and network-wide dependencies) and recapitulates the global behavior of this network for an array of published data on T cell activation in wild-type and knock-out conditions. More importantly, the model predicted unexpected signaling events after antibody-mediated perturbation of CD28 and after genetic knockout of the kinase Fyn that were subsequently experimentally validated. Finally, we show that the logical model reveals key elements and potential failure modes in network functioning and provides candidates for missing links. In summary, our large-scale logical model for T cell activation proved to be a promising in silico tool, and it inspires immunologists to ask new questions. We think that it holds valuable potential in foreseeing the effects of drugs and network modifications.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Expert knowledge in journal articles is an important source of data for reconstructing biological pathways and creating new hypotheses. An important need for medical research is to integrate this data with high throughput sources to build useful models that span several scales. Researchers traditionally use mental models of pathways to integrate information and development new hypotheses. Unfortunately, the amount of information is often overwhelming and these are inadequate for predicting the dynamic response of complex pathways. Hierarchical computational models that allow exploration of semi-quantitative dynamics are useful systems biology tools for theoreticians, experimentalists and clinicians and may provide a means for cross-communication.
RESULTS: A novel approach for biological pathway modeling based on hybrid intelligent systems or soft computing technologies is presented here. Intelligent hybrid systems, which refers to several related computing methods such as fuzzy logic, neural nets, genetic algorithms, and statistical analysis, has become ubiquitous in engineering applications for complex control system modeling and design. Biological pathways may be considered to be complex control systems, which medicine tries to manipulate to achieve desired results. Thus, hybrid intelligent systems may provide a useful tool for modeling biological system dynamics and computational exploration of new drug targets. A new modeling approach based on these methods is presented in the context of hedgehog regulation of the cell cycle in granule cells. Code and input files can be found at the Bionet website: www.chip.ord/~wbosl/Software/Bionet.
CONCLUSION: This paper presents the algorithmic methods needed for modeling complicated biochemical dynamics using rule-based models to represent expert knowledge in the context of cell cycle regulation and tumor growth. A notable feature of this modeling approach is that it allows biologists to build complex models from their knowledge base without the need to translate that knowledge into mathematical form. Dynamics on several levels, from molecular pathways to tissue growth, are seamlessly integrated. A number of common network motifs are examined and used to build a model of hedgehog regulation of the cell cycle in cerebellar neurons, which is believed to play a key role in the etiology of medulloblastoma, a devastating childhood brain cancer.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cancer is a heterogeneous disease resulting from the accumulation of genetic defects that negatively impact control of cell division, motility, adhesion and apoptosis. Deregulation in signaling along the EgfR-MAPK pathway is common in breast cancer, though the manner in which deregulation occurs varies between both individuals and cancer subtypes.
RESULTS: We were interested in identifying subnetworks within the EgfR-MAPK pathway that are similarly deregulated across subsets of breast cancers. To that end, we mapped genomic, transcriptional and proteomic profiles for 30 breast cancer cell lines onto a curated Pathway Logic symbolic systems model of EgfR-MAPK signaling. This model was composed of 539 molecular states and 396 rules governing signaling between active states. We analyzed these models and identified several subtype-specific subnetworks, including one that suggested Pak1 is particularly important in regulating the MAPK cascade when it is over-expressed. We hypothesized that Pak1 over-expressing cell lines would have increased sensitivity to Mek inhibitors. We tested this experimentally by measuring quantitative responses of 20 breast cancer cell lines to three Mek inhibitors. We found that Pak1 over-expressing luminal breast cancer cell lines are significantly more sensitive to Mek inhibition compared to those that express Pak1 at low levels. This indicates that Pak1 over-expression may be a useful clinical marker to identify patient populations that may be sensitive to Mek inhibitors.
CONCLUSIONS: All together, our results support the utility of symbolic system biology models for identification of therapeutic approaches that will be effective against breast cancer subsets.},

	Abstract = {Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a proinflammatory cytokine that induces conflicting pro- and antiapoptotic signals whose relative strengths determine the extent of cell death. TNF receptor (TNFR) has been studied in considerable detail, but it is not known how crosstalk among antagonistic pro- and antiapoptotic signals is achieved. Here we report an experimental and computational analysis of crosstalk between prodeath TNF and prosurvival growth factors in human epithelial cells. By applying classifier-based regression to a cytokine-signaling compendium of approximately 8000 intracellular protein measurements, we demonstrate that cells respond to TNF both directly, via activated TNF receptor, and indirectly, via the sequential release of transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). We refer to the contingent and time-varying series of extracellular signals induced by TNF as an "autocrine cascade." Time-dependent crosstalk of synergistic and antagonistic autocrine circuits may serve to link cellular responses to the local environment.},

	Abstract = {Signal transduction pathways control cellular responses to stimuli, but it is unclear how molecular information is processed as a network. We constructed a systems model of 7980 intracellular signaling events that directly links measurements to 1440 response outputs associated with apoptosis. The model accurately predicted multiple time-dependent apoptotic responses induced by a combination of the death-inducing cytokine tumor necrosis factor with the prosurvival factors epidermal growth factor and insulin. By capturing the role of unsuspected autocrine circuits activated by transforming growth factor-alpha and interleukin-1alpha, the model revealed new molecular mechanisms connecting signaling to apoptosis. The model derived two groupings of intracellular signals that constitute fundamental dimensions (molecular "basis axes") within the apoptotic signaling network. Projection along these axes captures the entire measured apoptotic network, suggesting that cell survival is determined by signaling through this canonical basis set.},

	Abstract = {In this article, optimization-based frameworks are introduced for elucidating the input-output structure of signaling networks and for pinpointing targeted disruptions leading to the silencing of undesirable outputs in therapeutic interventions. The frameworks are demonstrated on a large-scale reconstruction of a signaling network composed of nine signaling pathways implicated in prostate cancer. The Min-Input framework is used to exhaustively identify all input-output connections implied by the signaling network structure. Results reveal that there exist two distinct types of outputs in the signaling network that either can be elicited by many different input combinations or are highly specific requiring dedicated inputs. The Min-Interference framework is next used to precisely pinpoint key disruptions that negate undesirable outputs while leaving unaffected necessary ones. In addition to identifying disruptions of terminal steps, we also identify complex disruption combinations in upstream pathways that indirectly negate the targeted output by propagating their action through the signaling cascades. By comparing the obtained disruption targets with lists of drug molecules we find that many of these targets can be acted upon by existing drug compounds, whereas the remaining ones point at so-far unexplored targets. Overall the proposed computational frameworks can help elucidate input/output relationships of signaling networks and help to guide the systematic design of interference strategies.},

This approach is called extreme signaling pathway analysis and involves the description of network properties with systemically independent basis vectors called extreme pathways. From the extreme signaling pathways, emergent systems properties of the JAK-STAT signaling network have been characterized, including 1), a mathematical definition of network crosstalk; 2), an analysis of redundancy in signaling inputs and outputs; 3), a study of reaction participation in the network; and 4), a delineation of 85 correlated reaction sets, or systemic signaling modules. This study is the first such analysis of an actual biological signaling system. Extreme signaling pathway analysis is a topologically based approach and assumes a balanced use of the signaling network. As large-scale reconstructions of signaling networks emerge, such scalable analyses will lead to a description of the fundamental systems properties of signal transduction networks.},

@article{Li2010,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Drugs can influence the whole metabolic system by targeting enzymes which catalyze metabolic reactions. The existence of interactions between drugs and metabolic reactions suggests a potential way to discover drug targets.
RESULTS: In this paper, we present a computational method to predict new targets for approved anti-cancer drugs by exploring drug-reaction interactions. We construct a Drug-Reaction Network to provide a global view of drug-reaction interactions and drug-pathway interactions. The recent reconstruction of the human metabolic network and development of flux analysis approaches make it possible to predict each metabolic reaction's cell line-specific flux state based on the cell line-specific gene expressions. We first profile each reaction by its flux states in NCI-60 cancer cell lines, and then propose a kernel k-nearest neighbor model to predict related metabolic reactions and enzyme targets for approved cancer drugs. We also integrate the target structure data with reaction flux profiles to predict drug targets and the area under curves can reach 0.92.
CONCLUSIONS: The cross validations using the methods with and without metabolic network indicate that the former method is significantly better than the latter. Further experiments show the synergism of reaction flux profiles and target structure for drug target prediction. It also implies the significant contribution of metabolic network to predict drug targets. Finally, we apply our method to predict new reactions and possible enzyme targets for cancer drugs.},

We therefore were motivated to investigate which migration properties measured in various 2D assays might be reflective of 3D migratory behavioral responses. We used human triple-negative breast cancer lines stimulated by a panel of receptor tyrosine kinase ligands relevant to mammary carcinoma progression. Whereas 2D migration properties did not correlate well with 3D behavior across multiple growth factors, we found that increased membrane protrusion elicited by growth factor stimulation did relate robustly to enhanced 3D migration properties of the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 lines. Interestingly, we observed this to be a more reliable relationship than cognate receptor expression or activation levels across these and two additional mammary tumor lines.},

Conversely, traditional approaches to analyzing cell signaling are narrow in scope and cannot easily make use of network-level data. Here, we combine network analysis and functional experimentation by using a hybrid approach in which graphs are converted into simple mathematical models that can be trained against biochemical data. Specifically, we created Boolean logic models of immediate-early signaling in liver cells by training a literature-based prior knowledge network against biochemical data obtained from primary human hepatocytes and 4 hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines exposed to combinations of cytokines and small-molecule kinase inhibitors. Distinct families of models were recovered for each cell type, and these families clustered topologically into normal and diseased sets.},

Such specificity is critical for understanding disease and designing drugs. Here we describe a computational approach--implemented in the free CNO software--for turning signalling networks into logical models and calibrating the models against experimental data. When a literature-derived network of 82 proteins covering the immediate-early responses of human cells to seven cytokines was modelled, we found that training against experimental data dramatically increased predictive power, despite the crudeness of Boolean approximations, while significantly reducing the number of interactions. Thus, many interactions in literature-derived networks do not appear to be functional in the liver cells from which we collected our data. At the same time, CNO identified several new interactions that improved the match of model to data. Although missing from the starting network, these interactions have literature support. Our approach, therefore, represents a means to generate predictive, cell-type-specific models of mammalian signalling from generic protein signalling networks.},

@article{Starbuck1992,
	Abstract = {We apply a mathematical model for receptor-mediated cell uptake and processing of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to analyze and predict proliferation responses to fibroblastic cells transfected with various forms of the EGF receptor (EGFR) to EGF. The underlying conceptual hypothesis is that the mitogenic signal generated by EGF/EGFR binding on the cell surface, via stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinase activity, is attenuated when the receptors are downregulated and growth factor is depleted by endocytic internalization and subsequent intracellular degradation. Hence, the cell proliferation rate ought to depend on receptor/ligand binding and trafficking parameters as well as on intrinsic receptor signal transduction properties. The goal of our modeling efforts is to formulate this hypothesis in quantitative terms. The mathematical model consists of kinetic equations for binding, internalization, degradation, and recycling of EGF and EGFR, along with an expression relating DNA synthesis rate to EGF/EGFR complex levels. Parameter values have been previously determined from independent binding and trafficking kinetic experiments on B82 fibroblasts transfected with wild-type and mutant EGFR. We show that this model can successfully interpret literature data for EGF-dependent growth of NR6 fibroblasts transfected with wild-type EGFR. Moreover, it successfully predicts the literature observation that NR6 cells transfected with a delta 973 truncation mutant EGFR, which is kinase-active but internalization-deficient, require an order of magnitude lower EGF concentration than cells with wild-type EGFR for half-maximal proliferation rate. This result demonstrates that it may be feasible to genetically engineer mammalian cell lines with reduced growth factor requirements by a rational, nonempirical approach. We explore by further model computations the possibility of exploiting other varieties of EGFR mutants to alter growth properties of fibroblastic cells, based on relationships between changes in the primary structure of the EGF receptor and the rates of specific receptor/ligand binding and trafficking processes. Our studies show that the ability to predict cell proliferation as a function of serum growth factors such as EGF could lead to the designed development of cells with optimized growth responses. This approach may also aid in elucidation of mechanisms underlying loss of normal cell proliferation control in malignant transformation, by demonstrating that receptor trafficking dynamics may in some cases play as important a role as intrinsic signal transduction in determining the overall resulting mitogenic response.},

@article{Schoeberl2002,
	Abstract = {We present a computational model that offers an integrated quantitative, dynamic, and topological representation of intracellular signal networks, based on known components of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor signal pathways. The model provides insight into signal-response relationships between the binding of EGF to its receptor at the cell surface and the activation of downstream proteins in the signaling cascade. It shows that EGF-induced responses are remarkably stable over a 100-fold range of ligand concentration and that the critical parameter in determining signal efficacy is the initial velocity of receptor activation. The predictions of the model agree well with experimental analysis of the effect of EGF on two downstream responses, phosphorylation of ERK-1/2 and expression of the target gene, c-fos.},

@article{Kholodenko1999,
	Abstract = {During the past decade, our knowledge of molecular mechanisms involved in growth factor signaling has proliferated almost explosively. However, the kinetics and control of information transfer through signaling networks remain poorly understood. This paper combines experimental kinetic analysis and computational modeling of the short term pattern of cellular responses to epidermal growth factor (EGF) in isolated hepatocytes. The experimental data show transient tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) and transient or sustained response patterns in multiple signaling proteins targeted by EGFR. Transient responses exhibit pronounced maxima, reached within 15-30 s of EGF stimulation and followed by a decline to relatively low (quasi-steady-state) levels. In contrast to earlier suggestions, we demonstrate that the experimentally observed transients can be accounted for without requiring receptor-mediated activation of specific tyrosine phosphatases, following EGF stimulation. The kinetic model predicts how the cellular response is controlled by the relative levels and activity states of signaling proteins and under what conditions activation patterns are transient or sustained. EGFR signaling patterns appear to be robust with respect to variations in many elemental rate constants within the range of experimentally measured values. On the other hand, we specify which changes in the kinetic scheme, rate constants, and total amounts of molecular factors involved are incompatible with the experimentally observed kinetics of signal transfer. Quantitation of signaling network responses to growth factors allows us to assess how cells process information controlling their growth and differentiation.},

@article{Forsten1994,
	Abstract = {T-cell proliferation is regulated by the autocrine ligand interleukin-2 (IL-2), for which these cells possess dual, low-affinity and high-affinity receptor populations. Proliferation stimulated by IL-2 is dependent upon ligand binding to p75, a component of the high-affinity receptor. As with other cells exhibiting dual receptor systems, a central question is, therefore: what is the role of the low-affinity receptor population? We apply a mathematical modeling approach to examine three alternative mechanisms that have been suggested for the role of low-affinity receptors: a ligand reservoir, a receptor reservoir, and a ligand carrier. Using model parameter values specific to the IL-2/T-cell system, we find that only the ligand carrier mechanism leads to binding of autocrine ligand to high-affinity receptors that is increased over levels found on a single, pre-formed high-affinity receptor population. With the ligand reservoir and the receptor reservoir mechanisms, the presence of the low-affinity receptors actually diminishes high-affinity receptor binding due to competition. In contrast, excess low-affinity receptors can act to enhance the level of high-affinity receptor complexes when membrane transport is included, indicating that should this mechanism be inhibited, cell response could potentially be reduced or eliminated. The ligand carrier effect is especially significant for cells expressing a large number (> 10(5) receptors/cell) low-affinity receptors, and at low cell densities (< 10(4) cells/ml). This may at least partially account for the behavior demonstrated by early phase adult T-cell leukemia cells.},
